# Intro
My master's thesis project in completion of the Data Science & Entrepreneurship master at the Jheronimus Academy of Data Science. If you would like to reuse any of these materials, I highly recommend to [read the thesis](https://github.com/KevinReijnders/MSc-Thesis-Septic-Shock-Mortality-Prediction/raw/main/MSc%20Thesis%20Reijnders%20-%20Septic%20Shock%20Mortality%20Prediction%20using%20DL%20and%20PFS.pdf) first. Appendix C contains more instructions on how to use the materials in this repo.
